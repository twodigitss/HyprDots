## Author notes
If you are going to use this dotfiles, inside the verticalBar directory exists a file named `"variables.js"`, there is where i store dictionaries of icons and commands to be used through some files that requires them. You might want to rename the configuration directory `("/home/your_name/.config" as example)` to match your actual config directory, where you must move the "ags" folder.<br>
Not changing this values might result in some icons/images not displaying up correctly, it is not a critical error or something... just wont display as it should. It is up to you.
<br><br>
I also added an executable file named "launch.sh", that it is used to launch and re-launch ags.<br>
You can bind to your like. In my case i use `SUPER + R` to do such task.
