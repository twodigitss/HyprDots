    #        <i>italic</i>
    #        <s>strikethrough</s>
    #        <u>underline</u>
    # strip: This setting is provided for compatibility with some broken
    #        clients that send markup even though it's not enabled on the
    #        server. Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is
    #        simplistic so using this option outside of matching rules for
    #        specific applications *IS GREATLY DISCOURAGED*.
    #
    # no:    Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as
    #        plain text. Dunst will not advertise that it has the body-markup
    #        capability if this is set as a global setting.
    #
    # It's important to note that markup inside the format option will be parsed
    # regardless of what this is set to.

# /-----/ LEGACY CONFIGURATION /-----/

    # do not support RandR and using it on systems that support RandR is highly
    # discouraged.

    # layout changes.

    # * none: Don't do anything.
    	# * do_action: Invoke the action determined by the action_name rule. If there is no such action, open the context menu.
    		# * open_url: If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple ones, open the context menu.

    # * close_current: Close current notification.
    	# * close_all: Close all notifications.
    		# * context: Open context menu for the notification.
    
    # * context_all: Open context menu for all notifications.
    # These values can be strung together for each mouse event, and
    # will be executed in sequence.
